### Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

I am a Production Engineer fascinated with solving problems through data.

Also passionated with sports and will be working some projects within this subject in the future during my free time.

## Projects

* https://github.com/hfernandescfc/covid - Focused on following up to date information of covid in my state, on this project I scrapped data provided by
the government and manipulated it in order to create multiple visualizations such as most frequent syntomns, number of new cases and deaths and hospitalizations.

* https://github.com/hfernandescfc/RaspandoCartola - Still a work in progress. On this project I got data from Cartola API and manipulated it with pandas and numpy
in order to create DataFrames to further analyse data from the fantasy game. The goal here is to create visualizations using statistics to predict future performances.

* https://github.com/hfernandescfc/House_Predictions - Working on the famous dataset of house prices. On this notebook I tried to go through all the steps
that are necessary to deploy a regression machine learning algorithm. I described what was in my mind in each step so it could be used as a guide for other begginers.
On it there is a preprocessing step where I handled with missing values and with the different data types. I Further perform a simple EDA to understand the relationship between the variables. After that, the data was transformed with scikit-learn and then fitted to some regression models.
