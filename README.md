### Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

I am a Production Engineer fascinated with solving problems through data.

Also passionated with sports and will be working some projects within this subject in the future during my free time.

## Projects

* https://github.com/hfernandescfc/covid - Focused on following up to date information of covid in my state, on this project I scrapped data provided by
the government and manipulated it in order to create multiple visualizations such as most frequent syntomns, number of new cases and deaths and hospitalizations.

* https://github.com/hfernandescfc/RaspandoCartola - Still a work in progress. On this project I got data from Cartola API and manipulated it with pandas and numpy
in order to create DataFrames to further analyse data from the fantasy game. The goal here is to create visualizations using statistics to predict future performances.
